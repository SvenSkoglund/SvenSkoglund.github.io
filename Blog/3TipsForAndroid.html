    <em>3 Tips for Building your First Android App</em>
  </h1>

  <p>
    Hello Internet,
</p>
<p>
    I have just finished making my very first Android App. I want to share a few of my thoughts on what went well and I will do differently next time. Since I am just getting started, I think I can share a beginner’s perspective that will be useful for other beginners.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Learn the basics of Java, XML, and Android Studio</strong>
</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Java</strong>
</p>
    <p>If you want to make an app for Android, you won’t get very far without knowing at least the fundamentals of Java and XML. This would be like thinking you could cook a delicious meal without knowing what stoves and knives are. Fortunately, there are lots of good resources for learning Java and XML online that are very affordable. Here are the ones that I used before starting with Android:</p>

    <p><strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-program-with-java-1/">Learn to Program with Java for Complete Beginners - Part 1:</a> </strong></p>

    <p>This was the first course that I took on Java. Even if you have never programmed, you should be able to start here and start making progress. It is taught by Jamie Romero from Learn by the Byte. This is a very introductory course and starts out very simply with installing Java on your machine, writing a hello world program, and eventually getting into data types and expressions. I really enjoyed the course and the instructor. So much so that I decided to sign up for Part 2.</p>

    <p> <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-program-with-java-2/">Learn to Program with Java for Complete Beginners - Part 2</a>
    </strong> </p>

    <p>Part 2 of this program is still taught by Jamie and builds upon the skills learned in Part 1. You will learn about decision making, debugging, methods, classes, and other topics that were slightly out of the scope of Part 1. Again, I devoured the material and was eager for more.</p>

    <p> <strong><a href="https://www.udemy.com/introduction-to-java-programming/">Introduction to Java for Programmers</a>
    </strong> </p>

    <p>This course is taught by, guess who, Jamie Romero again. I was pleased with the first two courses and wanted to continue deepening my knowledge. Luckily, the same teacher offered another course that would add to the first two I had taken. If you have some experience in programming already, you could probably skip the first two courses and just start here. The topics covered include things such as starting in Eclipse IDE, Object Oriented Programming, Input/Output Streams, Exception Handling, Packages, and lots of other fun stuff. I would have continued learning from Jamie, but this was the last course by him I could find on Udemy. Again, I highly recommend the course.</p>

    <p> <strong>XML : <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/">w3 Schools</a></strong>  </p>

    <p> To learn XML the only resource I used was the link above, w3schools. I just wanted to learn the basics need to help me get my app to completion, and going through their pages on XML sequentially gave me enough to get started. It seems like XML is much easier to learn than Java and I wouldn’t spend too much time here. Learn the basics of Java, then pick up the pieces of XML you need as you go forward. </p>

    <p> <strong> Android Studio: <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851">Course by Google</a> </strong> </p>



    <p>This is an awesome resource. I’m not sure which of the following facts is better: The fact that the course was made by Google themselves, or the fact that the course is free.</p>

    <p>Google really did a great job with this course. The material is presented well and in an entertaining way. It makes you feel like you’re getting a little taste of the Google culture. It will also give you the tools you need to eventually turn your own vision for an app into reality. As of writing this post, I have not finished the course, because I found the things I needed to get my app started after just working through the first couple of lessons. I highly recommend this course and I look forward to continuing with it and to explore the other fascinating courses at Udacity.com</p>


    	<p> <strong>2. Pick a project that you would find useful, that you could actually create</strong> </p>

    <p>My first project was a simple app. Essentially, it was a compound interest calculator. I love saving (investing) money and I wanted an app that would show me quickly and easily how much the money I am spending will be worth in the future. Basically, this is an app to make impulse purchases seem a little less attractive.</p>

    <p>The app is simple. The main page prompts “How much are you about to spend?” and the user enters an amount and presses the “Calculate” button. Then the app returns “Value in X years: $XXX”. There is also a button to clear the returned value and a menu button on the main page. The menu page has settings to adjust the interest rate and the time in years that you wish to calculate.</p>

    <p>The app is simple in its idea, but was definitely a challenge to create. Between writing the Java files and creating the XML design sheets, I had a lot to learn. There were many obstacles that I had to find solutions for. This is why I recommend starting with an idea that is reasonable for your skill level. Even if you are confident getting started, there will be challenges along the way. This brings me to my final tip:</p>

    	<p> <strong>3. Learn to problem solve</strong> </p>

    <p>This tip may seem so obvious that it is painful. It is obvious, and it is painful. Every single problem I encountered in making this app was painful. Every single one was a moment where I had to overcome something inside of myself. This sounds dramatic, but it’s the truth.</p>

    <p>The most valuable resource I used for solving my problem was Stackoverflow.com. There is a super active community of people who have already encountered the problem you are having. If you can’t find your question being asked by someone else, you can ask it yourself and will quickly receive an answer.</p>

    <p>I have one message of caution when using StackOverflow: Don’t copy code into your project if you don’t understand what it is doing!</p>

    <p>I made this mistake. I totally ruined the first version of my app and could not fix whatever it was that I had broken. To this day, I still do not know what I did to my app. However, I created FutureValue2 and tried again, knowing now to use more caution when I copy code from the internet into my app.</p>


    <p>There you have it friends, 3 Tips for Building Your First Android App:
    Learn the basics of Java, XML, and Android Studio
    Start with something small, but useful.
    Learn to problem solve (carefully)</p>

    <p>I hope this blog post serves you well and I hope you have as much fun creating your first Android app as I did. I hope that all of you will experience the joy of seeing your visions come to life. Leave a comment below if you have other tips or lessons you learned while starting with Android. Thank you for reading!</p>
