    <em>Switch Vs If/Else</em>
  </h1>

  <p>
  <strong> The difference between a switch and an if/else statement is that switches allow for the programmer to easily create many different sections of code that will execute that require the variable in question to match exactly to a specific case. If/else statements, on the other hand, allow certain blocks of code to execute if the logical expression within the if statement is true. To make it short: Switches aim to match your variable to a specific value, if/else can also match to specific values, but can also match to ranges of value.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
  With switch statements it is easier to check for many different things that your variable might be equal to and to run different sections of code accordingly. For example, if you are checking the integer "months" to see which month the user entered, and then to run a code unique for each month, it is easier and neater to write "case: 1" "case: 2" "case: 3" rather than to write if "(months == 1){}" "if (months == 2){}" "if (months == 3)" etc. The point I am trying to make, is that if your variable has many finite options on what it might be, and many different options on what to do depending on what it is, then a switch is probably better than if/else.

      <strong>
  However, if your variable has options that are not finite and you want to check for things such as "is the variable less than x" or "is the variable greater than y" then you will need an if else statement. Unlike switches, if/else statements can utilize greater/less than opperations. This allows you to execute certain blocks of code if your variable is equal to a range of possibilities, rather running code only if it is equal to a definite case.
