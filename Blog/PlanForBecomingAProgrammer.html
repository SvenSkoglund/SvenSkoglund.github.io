    <em>My Plan for Becoming a Computer Programmer</em>
  </h1>

  <p>
    	First, a little bit of my background. I am 25 years old. I began teaching myself to program for the first time about 3 months ago. My plan is to be a full time developer within the following year. Here is my plan. </p>

    <p> <strong>Practice coding on my own</strong> </p>

    		<p>The first part of the plan is to practice coding as often as I can, ideally every day. I have been teaching myself Java using online courses mostly at udemy.com. Now I am using Java to build Android apps. As of writing this post, I have created two simple apps.</p>
    		Practicing on my own has been important and also very educational. I have been practicing going visioning something to making it a reality. In practicing Android, I have begun learning about XML layouts and how to make an app presentable. I have also learned how to find solutions to the problems that come up along the way. I have increased my programming skills greatly through my own self education and creations.
    		<p>Practicing on my own also allows my to add new contributions to my projects, which are all hosted on GitHub. When it comes time to apply for jobs, I will be able to show employers that I have been consistently contributing and working on my code for many months.</p>
    		I have also been using StackOverflow to ask questions to my problems. This is another resource I am thankful to have learned, and that I can show to employers one day too.


    <p> <strong>Writing this blog</strong> </p>

    		<p>Writing a blog was an idea I got from John Sohnmez at simpleprogrammer.com. He has made a name for himself through his own blog and recommends it to all of his readers/listeners/viewers. He claims it has been one of the single most important things he has done to set himself apart from other programmers and to start receiving opportunities for work. I know that I am new to programming, but John says it is always best to start right away, even if you are just learning to code. According to John, consistent writing will help to formulate your knowledge and refine your style. You will also, over time, develop a large body of work that will generate traffic and add to your reputation.</p>
    		<p>The blog, the GitHub posts, and StackOverflow profile will show future employers that I have been active in learning to code. They will be able to see that even though I am new, I have been working diligently.
</p>
    <p> <strong>Coding BootCamp</strong> </p>


    	<p>In the beginning of March I will be in my first week of coding BootCamp at Skill Distillery in Denver, CO. I am very excited for this BootCamp. I am expecting it to be one of the most difficult things I have done, but also the most rewarding. This school has very high placement rates of it’s students into jobs and should prepare me thoroughly for being hired.</p>
    	<p>Skill Distillery is a full stack BootCamp specializing in Java. The also teach JavaScript, MySQL, JQuery, Rest, CSS, and lots of other in demand technologies. With my self taught experience, and the things I will learn in BootCamp, I will feel confident and well prepared to make my beginnings in the programming world.</p>

    <p> <strong>Gaining employment</strong> </p>

    		<p>Of course, the final step of the plan will be to gain employment. My plan is to find a job at a large company for my first job as a programmer. I would like to be in an environment where there are experience people around me who can show me the ropes. Once I have found a place to contribute to, I will continue developing skills and learning new, valuable things.
</p>

    	<p>I’ve described my basic plan for you here for becoming a paid programmer. I hope that by the time you are reading this, it has already come true.</p>
